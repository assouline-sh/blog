      <description>Over the summer I was at Benchling, and for the fall I joined Klaviyo as a Security Engineer! I&amp;rsquo;m so grateful they could accommodate my later start date, because the team seemed great and I was so happy to gain further exposure to how security engineering is implemented at another company. Especially one that was a fellow startup that recently had an IPO.
Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this recap almost a year later and my memory of my project details is fading.</description>

      <description>This past summer, I was a security engineering intern at Benchling, a biotech startup in SF! It was an amazing opportunity, and I feel greatly indebted to every single person I met there for being so kind and welcoming. I learned a lot about the company, how different security teams all work together in an enterprise, and about the beautiful city.
The recruiter told our 8 person intern class that we were chosen from over 10,000 applicants.</description>

      <description>Just finished my first co-op experience: 7 months at Draper Labs as a Cybersecurity Analyst working in the SOC.
Draper Labs is a non-profit research and development organization. This was my first time having a real adult job, and I learned a lot about how I want to move forward in the field, and about myself. I triaged daily alerts from Splunk, Carbon Black, and Proofpoint, which improved my skills in threat analysis, vulnerability management, and incident response.</description>
