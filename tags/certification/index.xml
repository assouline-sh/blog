      <description>Passed CySA+! For a few months, I biked to the office an hour early so I could fit in a study session before the start of the workday. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been on co-op as a Cybersecurity Analyst, I felt that obtaining this certification would be an appropriate reinforcement of the skills and knowledge I&amp;rsquo;m learning. Though there was a lot of content overlap with Security+, it delved deeper into threat detection and analysis, vulnerability management, and incident response.</description>

      <description>Passed Security+! After consistently studying all of Fall semester, I hunkered down during the last week of winter break to cram as many practice tests as possible. It was important to me to set a goal and steadily move towards it to help build the habit of continuous self improvement and learning. The content supplemented my coursework nicely, and often acted as a reinforcement. I enjoyed that the questions pushed me to apply my conceptual knowledge to realistic scenarios.</description>
